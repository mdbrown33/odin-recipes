    <h1>Matt's Elite Chili</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've always been a big fan of chili, especially on cold winter days. One day, many years ago, I decided to experiment and come up with the perfect chili recipe based on things that would make it my own.</p>
    <p>Chili is one of those foods that holds a piece of the cook within it. It is a very personal dish that can be unique for anyone that takes the time to make it. This is what I settled on after experimenting with many different ingredients. Sometimes I still change it up and see if I can make additional improvements, but this is how I've been making it for years now.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs ground sausage (hot or mild, depending on what you prefer)</li>
        <li>60 oz canned diced tomatoes (if you like it spicy, choose one with jalepenos or similar peppers)</li>
        <li>12 oz canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 can of black beans</li>
        <li>1 can of pinto beans</li>
        <li>1 can of navy beans</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop onion, and dice garlic.</li>
        <li>Using medium-high heat, saute olive oil, onion, and garlic in a large pot until the onion starts softening up.</li>
        <li>Add diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and all three cans of <em>rinsed</em> beans to the pot.</li>
        <li>When the pot comes to a boil, reduce heat to bring pot to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Preheat an additional pan to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add sausage to preheated pan, and use a spatula or wooden spoon to crumble the sausage as it cooks.</li>
        <li>When the sausage is fully cooked, add it to the pot along with the juices in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add chili powder, cumin, and brown sugar to the pot.</li>
        <li>Simmer the contents of the pot for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your chili!</li>
