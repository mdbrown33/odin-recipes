    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How many of us have heard dinner will consist of baked chicken, and we shake our head and groan? Well that stops today.</p>
    <p>This baked chicken and vegetable recipe is easy, flexible, and always tastes fantastic. The one ingredient that is non-negotiable is the <strong>bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</strong>!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Any number of bone in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Lowry's seasoned salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>Two or three vegetables, chopped</li>

        <p class="tabletext">If you are unsure about what vegetables to use (though pretty much anything will do), common things I like to use are potatoes, onions, zucchini, and/or carrots.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Grease a baking dish with butter or olive oil.</li>
        <li>Add your chopped vegetables to the dish.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs on top of the vegetables in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Drizzle vegetables and chicken thighs with olive oil, or if you are using butter, place thin slices of butter throughout the dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle seasoning salt generously over the chicken thighs.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, until internal chicken temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can substitute the seasonings just as freely as the vegetable selection. The key is the long bake and the way it crisps the chicken skin. The chicken will also take in the seasoning, and the juices from the chicken will enhance the vegetables.</p>
    <p>My favorite alternate way to season the dish is with cayenne pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder.</p>
