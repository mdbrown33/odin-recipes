# odin-recipes

This is the first overall project in The Odin Project. It is called Recipes and is part of the Foundations Course.

The project is a small HTML website that includes three of my favorite recipes. These are things I make several times per year, year round. My chili recipe once won an office chili competition, so it's kind of a big deal. 

Secret pro-tip exclusive to those who are reading this readme: Omit the beans for an outstanding chili for use making chili dogs.

Additional secret pro-tip for parents that have kids that won't eat vegetables: Put literally any combination of any vegetables through a food processor and add it to the pot of chili during the simmer stage. The vegetables will be expertly hidden and undetectable by little ones. You're welcome Mom and Dad.
